<p>It has been a long time that I rarely use my laptop, because I am working. Labour intensive work. So intensive that I don&rsquo;t have time to use it? NO. You think it&rsquo;s starts to lose its meaning.</p>
<p>AI? Writing? News? Nothing really matters anymore. I just get up, work, play games, eat, sleep. That&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t need to use laptop. I can&rsquo;t make sufficient money to support my life.</p>
<p>I started working since last July. Till now, it&rsquo;s almost 9 months. Good work? Not really, but it pays. Enough money that I can buy food and stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the meaning? Yes, life is no different anywhere. You work, get paid, buy food, eat, sleep. That&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>However, after a certain period of time, that is, when the new things start to fade into the background, you starts to ask yourself questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>should i do something beyond the basic stuff?</li>
<li>i am more than this, right?</li>
<li>you ok living like this till you die?</li>
<li>what else do you want to do?</li>
<li>can it last?</li>
</ul>
<p>So you start to write, not to answer those questions. Just coz it&rsquo;s the easiest thing you can do. Log your thoughts. So you are a little bit better than that thoughtless being working like a log.</p>
