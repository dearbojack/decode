<p>Called mum this morning, she said we dont have much to talk about, because I dont (want to) have kids. The things is, I dont talk with most of the people nowadays. I am not a talkative person since i was a kid.</p>
<p>At work, i dont talk much. I dont like talking. I dont feel like talking. And sometimes I dont understand their small talks. I dont want to blend into their flirt, banters. I just smile. It&rsquo;s kind of stupid, but I dont care. So i got feedbacks that they dont know if I understand what they said. Most of the time I do.</p>
