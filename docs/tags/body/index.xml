      <description>Bought a Fitbit Inspire 3 for almost 60 pounds. Why do I need this? Now I think about it. It&amp;rsquo;s just a weak reason. I&amp;rsquo;d like to know how many steps I walked while at work per day. Turns out it is around 20k steps. It has great battery power which lasts for aound 10 days. Much better than those smart watches that you need to charge everyday.&#xA;And I found more functions that&amp;rsquo;s interesting during the last couple days of wearing it: sleep tracking, heart rate.</description>
