      <description>最近闲来无事，又开始了大学时候就一直玩得停不下来的Linux系统安装实验，感觉自己有病。&#xA;Tried Manjaro, Pop!OS, Fedora, OpenSuse, Ubuntu, etc. One thing I have to say is they have advanced alot since the last time I played (that was Ubuntu 6/8.04, around 2009 or so). Media codecs and Chinese IME are all working properly. Though some apps require some tweaking a bit, most of the functions people expect from a working laptop are okay.&#xA;Based on the distrohop, I have below conclusions:</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t know why lightdm failed to start, though I managed to switch to gdm and boot to gnome, but still I was unable to start xfce or i3, where I use to work. So, just installed Pop!OS 22.04 LTS on another partition. The rolling release of Manjaro, though interesting, is not so stable for daily use, I guess.&#xA;The switch is somewhat uneventful. Almost all apps I use were available also.</description>
