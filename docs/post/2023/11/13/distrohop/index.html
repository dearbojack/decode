<p>最近闲来无事，又开始了大学时候就一直玩得停不下来的Linux系统安装实验，感觉自己有病。</p>
<p>Tried <em>Manjaro</em>, <em>Pop!OS</em>, <em>Fedora</em>, <em>OpenSuse</em>, <em>Ubuntu</em>, etc. One thing I have to say is they have advanced alot since the last time I played (that was Ubuntu 6/8.04, around 2009 or so). Media codecs and Chinese IME are all working properly. Though some apps require some tweaking a bit, most of the functions people expect from a working laptop are okay.</p>
<p>Based on the <em>distrohop</em>, I have below conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Pop!OS</em> is the best distro out there.</li>
<li><code>ibus-rime</code> is the best Chinsese IME out there.</li>
<li><code>PaperWM</code> is the future of window management across all platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Gnome</strong> &gt; Xfce &raquo; KDE</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on stability and out-of-box usability, <em>Pop!OS</em> is unquestionably the best. And also due to the popularity of <code>Ubuntu</code>, it also has more <code>.deb</code> packages. Most of the popular apps offer <code>.deb</code> packages, like VSCode &amp; Obsidian.</p>
<p>Manjaro is also good, but the rolling release is kind of painful for someone who just wants a stable daily drive OS. Other distros either have ugly custimization or not-so-easy installation process, on which Pop is clearly the best and fastest.</p>
<p>I have to say, with its promising commercialization strategy, <code>Pop!OS</code> surely will become better in the future. (Ubuntu is just too bloated.)</p>
