<p>It turned out to be the longest delay I&rsquo;ve ever experienced till now. We didn&rsquo;t arrive at London till 3 am. Then we had to wait till 10am for the bus because that&rsquo;s the earliest bus to my place (rail service was on strike that day).</p>
<p>To sum it up, we wait for more than 6 hours in the airport for the flight and another 7 hours after it arrived. We missed the bus we booked earlier, had to buy new tickets. We arrived home around 12, more than 10 hours late than we expected.</p>
<p>相比下来，马略卡可能是此行最让人不那么不喜欢的地方了。吃的东西比巴塞罗那和阿姆斯特特丹都便宜一些，海也很干净，酒店也还可以。下次可以直接飞马略卡玩了。</p>
