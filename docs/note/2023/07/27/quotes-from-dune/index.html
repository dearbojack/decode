<p>Today, I had the chance to watch the movie <em>Dune</em>. While the plot may be straightforward, the film&rsquo;s captivating tempo and storytelling truly grabbed my attention. So I took note of several thought-provoking lines.</p>
<p><em>On Life</em>: “The mystery of life isn&rsquo;t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”</p>
<p><em>On Fear</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>On Living</em>: “It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.”</p>
<p><em>On Survival</em>: <strong>“Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.”</strong></p>
