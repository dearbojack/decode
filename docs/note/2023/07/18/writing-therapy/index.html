<blockquote>
<p>Writing is relaxing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you feel drown by anxiety, just sit down and start writing something. About what? It doesn&rsquo;t matter. There is paid classes on social media called &ldquo;mindful writing&rdquo;. Though I would never pay for that, but I agree with the idea behind the classes. Writing is the easiest way to get into the &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; state, which is sought after by most people who practice mindful related things.</p>
<p>Just start writing down what you are thinking and you will feel less stressed and a little bit of your anxiety goes away.</p>
