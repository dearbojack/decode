<p>We can live only once. All in all, your experience determines the quality of your life. That is to say, it is subjective (not objective). So we can fool ourselves into a better life.</p>
<p>You have the most compeletely life if you experienced the most kinds of lives, good, bad, happy, unhappy, dangerous, safe, poor or rich, girl or boy.</p>
<p>But, that is a slippery slope. You can have the experience of a murderer and be sentenced to death. That is special. You can also try your best to be the richest man in the world.</p>
<p>It can be a positive force, and a negative one.</p>
<p>That is how I think about life.</p>
