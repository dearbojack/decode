When talking about what it's like to have a retreat in a temple, Biao said they ask you to do all kinds of chores, this and that, not a minute of break, so to make sure you don't have time to overthink.

That's my work @ ALDI.

You need to work non-stop all the chores. They make sure you don't have time to drink or pee. That's how hard it is. 这么看来，我在这里的工作其实也是一种静修。I am a monk meditating in an ALDI temple. Glad it is paid.
