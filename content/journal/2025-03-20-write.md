It has been a long time that I rarely use my laptop, because I am working. Labour intensive work. So intensive that I don't have time to use it? NO. You think it's starts to lose its meaning. 

AI? Writing? News? Nothing really matters anymore. I just get up, work, play games, eat, sleep. That's it. I don't need to use laptop. I can't make sufficient money to support my life.

I started working since last July. Till now, it's almost 9 months. Good work? Not really, but it pays. Enough money that I can buy food and stuff.

That's the meaning? Yes, life is no different anywhere. You work, get paid, buy food, eat, sleep. That's life. 

However, after a certain period of time, that is, when the new things start to fade into the background, you starts to ask yourself questions:

- should i do something beyond the basic stuff?
- i am more than this, right?
- you ok living like this till you die?
- what else do you want to do?
- can it last?

So you start to write, not to answer those questions. Just coz it's the easiest thing you can do. Log your thoughts. So you are a little bit better than that thoughtless being working like a log.
